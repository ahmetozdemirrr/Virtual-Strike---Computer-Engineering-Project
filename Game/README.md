- Game Controller
- Android Device
- Stable Internet Connection
- A computer with Git installed

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ahmetozdemirrr/Virtual-Strike---Computer-Engineering-Project
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Game Directory:**
    Change the directory to the game module by running:
    ```sh
    cd virtual-strike/game
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed by running:

    - Ensure the game controller is properly connected and paired with the VR system.

5. **Launch the Game Application:**
    Start the game application on your Android device by running:
    ```sh
    cd ../Virtual-Strike---Computer-Engineering-Project/VR-Viewer-App/app/build/intermediates/apk
    ```
    Make sure your Android device is connected to the same network as your computer if they are used together.

## Game Modes

### Game 1: Target Practice

In this mode, you start in a lobby where you can pick up a weapon. Targets will appear from the polygon, and your objective is to shoot them for points. Be careful not to hit the Deer targets as they will deduct points. Focus on hitting the Barrel targets to score. The game ends after a certain period, and you can choose to return to the lobby or restart the game.

#### Controls:

- **Shoot:** Press the button on the game controller.
- **Aim:** Use your line of sight to aim at the targets.

### Game 2: Forest Adventure

This mode places you in a forest setting where you must navigate through obstacles and shoot targets. The environment is dynamic, requiring quick reflexes and effective scanning of the area to hit targets and avoid obstacles. Points are accumulated by successfully hitting the targets.

#### Controls:

- **Shoot:** Press the button on the game controller.
- **Move:** Use the joystick to navigate through the forest.

### Game 3: Platform Runner

In this platform running game, you need to avoid obstacles and collect points while running along three lanes. You can jump or slide to avoid obstacles and aim to score as high as possible.

#### Controls:

- **Jump:** Press forward on the joystick.
- **Slide:** Pull back on the joystick.
- **Move Left/Right:** Use the joystick to switch lanes.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues:**
  Ensure all devices (VR headset, game controller, Android device) are properly connected and paired. Check the Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection stability.

- **Performance Issues:**
  If the game is lagging or freezing, try restarting the application. Ensure your devices have sufficient battery life and are not overheating.

- **Gameplay Issues:**
  If targets are not appearing or the game is not responding, restart the game mode or reset your VR environment.

- **Software Updates:**
  Regularly check for software updates for your VR headset and game controller. Keeping your devices updated can resolve many common issues.
