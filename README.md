# Virtual Strike: Immersive Virtual Reality Shooting Game

## Introduction:

Welcome to the Virtual Strike repository! Virtual Strike is an ambitious project aimed at delivering an immersive gaming experience that seamlessly integrates real-life movements into the virtual world. This README.md file serves as a guide to understanding the project, its goals, technologies used, and how to get started contributing to or playing the game.

## Project Overview:

Virtual Strike is a shooting game designed to be played using VR (Virtual Reality) glasses and a specialized aiming device. The core objective of the project is to provide players with an interactive gaming experience where their real-life movements directly impact their in-game actions. By leveraging technologies such as Unreal Engine, VR headsets, Arduino for the aiming device, Node.js for server-side development, and Bluetooth for device connectivity, Virtual Strike aims to blur the lines between physical and virtual reality.

## Technologies Used:

- Unreal Engine: The game engine powering Virtual Strike, providing stunning visuals and immersive gameplay.
- VR Headset: Utilized to immerse players in the virtual world, allowing them to interact with the game environment.
- Raspberry Pi 4 (or similar microcontroller): Used to develop the handheld aiming device, enabling players to aim and shoot within the game.
- Node.js: Employed for server-side development to support backend functionality and multiplayer capabilities.
- Button and Cursor Sensor: Integrated into the aiming device to track real-life movements and translate them into in-game actions.
- Android Phone Projection: Enables players to experience the game on a computer with VR glasses by projecting the game onto an Android phone.
- Bluetooth Connectivity: Facilitates wireless connection between the handheld aiming device and the computer, ensuring seamless gameplay.

## Game Flow:

Virtual Strike offers players a diverse range of gameplay experiences, starting with a lobby-style area where players can select their equipment and missions. The primary objective of the game is to aim and shoot targets or entities that appear within the game environment. Players can expect dynamic challenges and varying missions to keep the gameplay engaging and exciting.

## Conclusion and Product:

With the completion of the Virtual Strike project, players will gain access to an innovative virtual reality shooting game that promises a truly immersive gaming experience. By merging cutting-edge technology with interactive entertainment, Virtual Strike aims to redefine the shooter genre and provide players with an unparalleled gaming adventure. Whether you're a VR enthusiast or a gaming aficionado, Virtual Strike offers something unique and exciting for everyone.
