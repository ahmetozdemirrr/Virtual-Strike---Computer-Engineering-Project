# VR Game Streaming Application

This repository contains the code for a VR game streaming application that allows users to play a computer game and view it on an Android phone using a VR headset. This project is developed as part of the CSE 396 Computer Engineering Project at Gebze Technical University in Spring 2024.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to enhance the gaming experience by leveraging VR technology. The application streams the game's video to an Android phone, enabling users to enjoy an immersive VR experience.

## Functionality

The application performs the following tasks:
- Streams video from the game running on a computer to an Android phone.
- Uses the phone's gyroscope to send rotation data back to the game for real-time interaction.
- Supports custom controllers for sending movement data to the game.

## Technologies

- Unreal Engine 5 (for game development)
- WebSocket (for real-time data transmission)
- Android Studio (for Android application development)
- Java and C++ (for backend and game logic)
- Python (for additional scripting)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vr-game-streaming.git
   cd vr-game-streaming
   ```
2. **Install dependencies for the server:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Build the Android application:**
   - Open the project in Android Studio.
   - Build the project to generate the APK file.
4. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. **Install the APK on the Android phone:**
   - Transfer the APK file to the phone.
   - Install the APK manually.
